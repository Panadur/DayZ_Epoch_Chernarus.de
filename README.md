My Codechanges to Epoch

This Repository does not hava any support. The codechanges here may or may not run on your Epochserver. In worst case, 
your Server will not even start properly when you use files from this repository. 
I wrote them for the Chernarus.de Servers an we already use modified code there.

This Repository contains code that was created by the Epoch Team and Kikyou2 from Chernarus.de. You are not allowed to 
use the code without their permission.
